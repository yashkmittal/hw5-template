    //      the entries in each of the ranges: [0, 99], [100, 199], [200, 299], ..., [900, 999].

    //  (2) q3b.txt which contains the same array B as in the previous part. However,
    //      you must use shared memory to represent a local copy of B in each block, and
    //      combine all local copies at the end to get a global copy of B.
    //  (3) q3c.txt which contains an array C of size 10 that keeps a count of
    //      the entries in each of the ranges: [0, 99], [0, 199], [0, 299], ..., [0, 999].
